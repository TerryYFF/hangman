For MacOS or Linux/Unix users, Perl has already been installed.
If you also have CPAN installed, please jump ahead to the "Commpn Program" Section.

Perlbrew:
I used Perlbrew, a perl installation management tool, on my Macbook.
(https://perlbrew.pl/)
To install Perlbrew, copy & paste the following command into your termina:
	\curl -L https://install.perlbrew.pl | bash
To initialize Perlbrew:
	source ~/perl5/perlbrew/etc/bashrc
To install a specific version of perl (e.g. v5.28.1):
	perlbrew install perl-5.28.1
	perlbrew switch perl-5.28.1
To install CPAN:
	curl -kL http://cpanmin.us | perl - App::cpanminus
To install a specific CPAN module (e.g. Tk):
	cpanm Tk

* If you're not using CPAN installed by perlbrew, the module installation command would be different:
	cpan Tk


Common Program:
Before executing the hangman program, one needs to have dictionary.txt in the same directory.
Also, make sure to install the Tk module from cpan.
In order to do this, in your terminal type:
	cpanm Tk
To run the executable program:
	perl hangman.pl
Expect the GUI to pop up.
Enjoy the game.


Creative Program:
Before executing the hyPERLinks program, one needs to have a pdf file or a text file in the same directory.
Then install the CAM::PDF module and the LWP::Simple module from cpan
In order to do these, in your terminal type:
	cpanm CAM::PDF
	cpanm LWP::Simple
To run the executable program:
	perl hyPERLinks.pl <file.pdf>
A txt file and an html file will be created in the same directory.
Or:
	perl hyPERLinks.pl <file.txt>
An html file will be created in the same directory.
